# Rational-Number-Operations-in-Java
This is a Java application that performs basic arithmetic operations on rational numbers. A rational number is a number in the form of a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0. The program can add, subtract, multiply, divide, compare, convert to floating point, and find absolute value for rational numbers.

#Getting Started
To run this program, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website.

#Usage
The program accepts two rational numbers from the user through command line arguments. The user should enter the numerator and denominator of each rational number in that order. The program will then perform the requested operation and display the result on the console.

#Rational Number Format
The format for entering a rational number is numerator/denominator. For example, to enter the rational number 2/3, the user should enter 2/3 as the input.

#Operations
The following operations can be performed on rational numbers:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Equality (==)
Floating Point Conversion (toDouble())
Absolute Value (abs())
Exception Handling
The program uses exception handling to handle bad inputs. If the user enters an invalid input, such as a zero denominator or a non-numeric value, the program will throw an exception and display an error message on the console.
